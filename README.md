<h1><b>Sql and Relation Database Project</b></h1>

### Project Overview
This project involves designing a relational database system for an e-library application that manages multiple libraries. The system allows users to borrow books, place holds on unavailable books, and manage their user accounts. The database design covers essential features like multi-library management, book collection tracking, loan and hold systems, and user registration.

### ERD Diagram
The database schema is represented by an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), which defines the relationships between entities such as Libraries, Books, Users, Loans, and Holds.

### DDL Syntax
DDL Syntax is the syntax that used to make tables in **PostgreSQL**.

### Python Dummy Dataset 
Python dummy dataset is the syntax that used for make dummy dataset.


### Implementation
The database design is implemented using **PostgreSQL**. The tables and relationships were defined using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands. The ERD diagram was created using tools like **draw.io** or **dbdiagram.io**.

To implement the design in PostgreSQL:
1. Create the schema based on the ERD.
2. Define tables with appropriate fields, data types, and constraints.
3. Use **pgAdmin** or **psql** to run the DDL commands.
